 * How to test without multiple machines/players
 * Debugging (difficulty finding the part in our code that's not working as intended)
 * Working with low sleep and high stress

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * How to use remote commands (and how to make objects serializable)

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * Cards and counters not being removed after use
 * Placing counters (unable to place obstacles, instances of placing two counters on a road)
 * Pass turn not working as intended in plan travel if someone places a counter afterwards
