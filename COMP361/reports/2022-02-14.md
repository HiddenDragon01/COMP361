### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

 * Completing all sequence diagrams

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Using different platforms to make sequence diagrams
 * Cohesiveness of work while splitting tasks
 * Connecting to docker and running LobbyService

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * New platform to connect to an IP for the game server implementation
 * Much better idea of sequence diagrams without including network communication
 * Better understanding of sql and derby to use for server implementation


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * Game client-server interactions not implemented
 * Realized Amazon EC2 instance won't be a viable option for hosting the server because large influx of api calls lead to instance crashes. Tried to move the server to a raspberry pi then realized docker image provided is meant for amd64 architecture, not arm. After realizing that, tried to use derby and mysql and failed to do so after trying for a few days. In the end decided to run server locally on an amd64 device running ubuntu server
