### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Communication - difficult to know what others have done and what ideas they have
 * Using new programs - most members had difficulty downloading necessary softwares and programs, and with deploying lobby service, eating a lot of work time
 * Balancing work - with the final rush of the semester, there was trouble putting in the necessary time for the milestone

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Networking groundwork - while we didn't complete our goals, we have a much better idea of how it works and have faith for when we come back from break
 * Communication - going forward, we'll keep better track of what members are doing and communicate it more clearly to each other
 * Adaptability - finding ways around problems when the most obvious solution doesn't work


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * The networking as a whole
 * Accessing log in tokens
